# Simple Calculator

## About

This project is a simple calculator implemented in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user.  This tool is useful for quick calculations and serves as a basic example of a Python program.


This project was created by Carlos Mejia.  No specific affiliations or related projects are currently associated with this simple calculator.


## Description

This calculator takes two numbers as input from the user via the command line. It then calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers. The program utilizes Python's built-in mathematical operators for straightforward calculations.  Error handling for division by zero is not included in this basic implementation.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a fundamental Python program. It serves as a starting point for learning basic input/output operations and fundamental arithmetic in Python.  Future versions could incorporate more advanced features.


## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
    * Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **User-Friendly Input:**
    * Prompts the user to enter two numbers clearly.
* **Clear Output:**
    * Displays the results in a well-formatted manner.



## Requirements

* Python 3.x


## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.  You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  Save the `calculator.py` file to your local machine.
3.  You can run the script directly from your terminal or command prompt using: `python calculator.py`


## Usage

This calculator can be run from the command line or any terminal-based environment.  No specific IDE is required, although any text editor and a Python interpreter are sufficient.

* **Example 1:** Calculating the sum of 5 and 3
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory containing `calculator.py`.
    *   Execute the command: `python calculator.py`.
    *   The program will prompt you to enter two numbers. Enter 5 and then 3.
    *   The output will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of 5 and 3.

* **Example 2:** Calculating the quotient of 10 and 2
    *   Follow the same steps as Example 1, but enter 10 and 2 as the inputs.
